# Guide for Uploading NBA Tech Website to cPanel

This guide will walk you through the process of uploading your Next.js static website to cPanel.

## Files to Upload

You need to upload the entire contents of the `out` directory to your cPanel hosting. This directory contains all the static files generated by Next.js.

## Step-by-Step Upload Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Files

The static export has already been generated in the `out` directory. This contains all the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets needed for your website.

### 2. Log in to cPanel

1. Go to your hosting provider's cPanel login page (usually at `https://yourdomain.com/cpanel`)
2. Enter your username and password
3. Click "Login"

### 3. Access the File Manager

1. In cPanel, find and click on the "File Manager" icon
2. This will open the file manager interface

### 4. Navigate to Your Website's Root Directory

1. In the file manager, navigate to your website's root directory
   - This is typically `public_html` or `www` or `htdocs`
2. If you want to install in a subdirectory, navigate to that directory

### 5. Upload Your Files

#### Method 1: Upload Files Directly

1. Click the "Upload" button in the cPanel file manager
2. In the upload interface, click "Select File" or drag and drop files
3. Select all files and folders from your local `out` directory
4. Wait for the upload to complete

#### Method 2: Upload a ZIP Archive (Recommended for Large Sites)

1. Create a ZIP archive of the contents of the `out` directory:
   - Right-click the `out` folder
   - Select "Send to" > "Compressed (zipped) folder"
   - Or use a tool like 7-Zip or WinRAR

2. In cPanel File Manager, click the "Upload" button
3. Upload the ZIP file to your website's root directory
4. Once uploaded, select the ZIP file in cPanel
5. Click "Extract" and extract the contents to the current directory
6. After extraction, you can delete the ZIP file

### 6. Set Proper Permissions (If Needed)

1. Select all files and folders
2. Click "Permissions" or "Change Permissions"
3. Set the following permissions:
   - Folders: 755 (drwxr-xr-x)
   - Files: 644 (-rw-r--r--)
4. Click "Change Permissions" to apply

### 7. Configure .htaccess (If Needed)

If you're using Apache (most cPanel servers do), you might need to create or modify the `.htaccess` file to handle routing properly:

1. Create a new file named `.htaccess` in your website's root directory
2. Add the following content:

```
# Enable rewriting
RewriteEngine On

# Handle 404 errors
ErrorDocument 404 /404.html

# Redirect to remove trailing slashes
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ /$1 [L,R=301]

# Serve HTML files without extension
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.html -f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1.html [L]
```

### 8. Test Your Website

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to your website's URL
3. Check that all pages load correctly
4. Test navigation, links, and other functionality
5. Verify that images and other assets are loading properly

## Troubleshooting

### Images or Assets Not Loading

- Check file paths in your HTML
- Ensure all assets were uploaded correctly
- Verify file permissions

### 404 Errors on Page Navigation

- Make sure the `.htaccess` file is configured correctly
- Check that all HTML files were uploaded

### Website Looks Different Than Expected

- Clear your browser cache
- Check if all CSS and JavaScript files were uploaded
- Inspect the browser console for errors

## Additional Notes

- If your website uses client-side routing, you might need additional configuration in your `.htaccess` file
- Some hosting providers might have specific requirements or limitations
- Consider enabling HTTPS for your website through cPanel's SSL/TLS section
